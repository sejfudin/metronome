# METRONOME

TSoftware metronomes run either as standalone applications on computers and smartphones or in music sequencing and audio multitrack software packages. In recording studio applications, such as film scoring, a software metronome may provide a track to synchronize musicians.

Metronome project is software that runs in the browser and has two basic functionality, set the beats per minute on input range element and start/stop button.

## How to clone, install and start the application
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository
### `git clone https://github.com/sejfudin/metronome.git`

2. Install NPM packages
### `npm install`

3. Start the project
### `npm start`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
